          <h1 class="sub-heading">What is Business Rescue?</h1>
          <p>
            Business rescue is a process aimed at facilitating the
            rehabilitation of a company that is financially distressed.
          </p>
          <h1 class="sub-heading">How can business recue help you?</h1>
          <p>
            Business rescue provides for the appointed a Business Rescue
            Practitioner (BRP) to take temporary supervision of the company and
            its affairs. It places a temporary moratorium (stay) on the rights
            of claimants against the company and allows for the BRP to draw up a
            plausible plan to rescue the company. The aim of business rescue is
            to restructure the affairs of a company in such a way that either
            maximises the likelihood of the company continuing in existence on a
            solvent basis, or it results in a better return for the creditors of
            the company than would ordinarily result from the liquidation of the
            company (section 128(1)(b)(iii) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008).
